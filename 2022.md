# Introduction

## Statement of case / mission statement
Last revised: 2006

Trust management is by nature a "horizontal" multi-disciplinary area that brings together communities that have been nurtured so far different "vertical" areas such as reputation systems,  security,  identity and access management, social networks, risk and compliance, formal models, legal IT, economics, etc.

With the help of the [IFIP Working Group](http://www.ifip.org/bulletin/bulltcs/tc11_aim.htm#wg11_11), trust management shall start to find its own space in the research scene, separate from the ones where it has been nurtured in the past.

## Aims
Working Group 11.11 aims to provide a forum for cross-disciplinary investigation of the application of trust as a means of establishing security and confidence in the global computing infrastructure, recognizing trust as a crucial enabler for meaningful and mutual beneficial interactions. The working group will bring together researchers with an interest in complementary aspects of trust, from both technology oriented disciplines and the field of law, social sciences and philosophy. In this way the working group will provide the common background necessary for advancing towards an in-depth understanding of the fundamental issues and challenges in the area of trust management in open systems.

The main membership will most likely be specialized researchers, both from universities and company laboratories. Government organizations and IFIP member societies and their members will be the main users of the results of the group.

Working Group 11.11 has a link to the area of other groups, both inside and outside IFIP and the group will seek actively for close cooperation with these groups.

## Scope
The scope of the WG 11.11 are (non-exhaustive and non-exclusive):

 * semantics and models for security and trust;
 * trust management architectures, mechanisms and policies;
 * trust in e-commerce, e-service, e-government;
 * trust and privacy (link with WG 9.6 / 11.7);
 * identity and trust management (link with WG 11.6);
 * trust securing digital as well as physical assets; and
 * social and legal aspects of trust (link with WG 9.6 / 11.7).
